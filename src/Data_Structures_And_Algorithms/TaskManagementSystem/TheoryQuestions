Singly Linked List
In singly linked list, each node contains a data part and a next pointer
pointing to the next node.

Doubly Linked List
In doubly Linked list, each node contains a data part, a reference to the next node,
and a reference to the previous node.
It allows traversal in both directions, making operations like deletion and insertion more flexible.

4.Insertion
TC:O(n) as we've to traverse the entire list to insert at end.
Deletion
TC:O(n)
In the worst case, we need to traverse the entire list to find and delete the task.
Searching
TC:O(n)
as we've to traverse the entire list if the item we are searching is at tail.
Traversal
TC:O(n)
as we've to traverse the entire list

Advantages of Linked List over Arrays
i.Dynamic size
Linked List can grow and shrink completely
ii.Efficient insertion/deletions
In Linked List links are adjusted not the whole list is shifted like arrays.
