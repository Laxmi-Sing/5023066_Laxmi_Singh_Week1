1.Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to find the upper bound
of the complexity of an algorithm. It is the maximum time taken by algorithm to execute.It helps in analyzing the
worst case scenario.

Best case is the scenario where the algorithm performs the minimum number of operation. Like in linear search
best case is when element to be searched at is present at 0th index and in binary search it is when element we are searching
for is at mid index.
Average Case is the scenario where the algorithm performs an average number of operations over all possible inputs.
Worst case is the scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of operations i.e. if the array is element is at last index
in linear search and in binary search when the target element is either in the first half or the second half of the divided array.

4.Linear Search Best Case TC: O(1) Worst case TC: O(n)
Binary Search Best Case TC: O(1) Worst case TC: O(log n)

Linear search is easy to implement but it's time complexity is
not good while working with large data sets. If the dataset is large
binary search should be used but it requires sorted array.
