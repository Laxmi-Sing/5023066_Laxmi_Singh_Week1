1. Data Structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories because when the size of the inventory will grow then deleting
, updating and inserting an entry will become difficult if a suitable data struct will not be used.
Therefore, to increase performance and to keep data in an organized manner using data structures and algorithms is essential.

ArrayList and HashMap will be the suitable data structures. HashMap will be more better as
it performs insertion, deletion in O(1) time which is faster as compared to insertion and deletion in ArrayList.

4.I've used HashMap for performing all the operations
Addition-> TC:O(1)
Deletion-> TC:O(1)
Updation-> TC:O(1)

We can optimize these operations by maintaining an optimal load factor i.e. 0.75 and
also by setting an initial capacity based on expected inventory size can reduce rehashing.
