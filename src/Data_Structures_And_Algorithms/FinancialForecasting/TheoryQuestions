1.Recursion is a method of solving problems where the function calls itself
and returns or stops when the base condition meets. It gives an elegant and
clear method for breaking down big issues into smaller, more manageable sub problems.

4.The time complexity of the recursive algorithm is O(n) because each
period results in a single recursive call until the base case is reached.
Each call does a constant amount of work, so the total time complexity is linear with respect to the number of periods.

Memoization is a  technique to store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur
again, thus saving computation time.
