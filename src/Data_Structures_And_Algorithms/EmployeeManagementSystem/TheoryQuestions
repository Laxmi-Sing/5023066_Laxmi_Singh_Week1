1.Arrays are a contiguous block of memory locations that store elements of the same data type. Each element
 in the array can be accessed directly by its index.
 Advantages
I. Constant time access
II. Arrays have no additional overhead per element, making them memory efficient.I
III.Easy to implement

4.Add
TC: O(1) in case of simple array not resizable array(ArrayList)
Search
TC:O(n) in WC we've to traverse full array
Traverse
TC:O(n) as we've to visit every element
Delete
TC:O(n)
Deletion in array is worst as after deletion we've to shift all
succeeding element

Limitations of Array
1.fixed size
2.Deletion inefficient
3.Inserting at a given index is inefficient as there is shifting overhead
4.not suitable for larger data sets

Arrays should be used when the dataset is not very large.
